## Abstract

Facebook is a company that operates at massive scale. In this talk we’ll talk about how we use `Python` at Facebook.
Be it building back-end services, fast prototyping, automation, scaling operations, or simply gluing together various pieces of our infrastructure, `Python` is at the heart of it and allows our engineers to quickly deliver working solutions.

## Notes

This was a generic Python @ Facebook talk I gave which talks about how we use Python to build small services using Thrift and how Python drives Meta's configuration management system (`configerator`).
