Hello visitor,  
my name is Angelo Failla (you might know me as `pallotron`), and this is my personal site.

I am an Italian immigrant (I refuse to use the term "expat") living in Dublin, Ireland, since 2008.

In my professional life, I am a Production Engineer (also known as a Site
Reliability Engineer or DevOps).
I used to work at Meta (formerly Facebook) from since March 2011, working from the Dublin, Ireland office and always gravitated around Data Center Automation teams. I left in April 2025 and I am currently enjoying the summer off before finding something new.

Outside of that, I love cooking, photography, and cycling.
Regarding cycling in particular, I enjoy long-distance cycling, also known as
randonneuring or audaxing. I have completed several 200km, 300km, 400km, 600km and
1000km rides. I have participated in the ~1200km Paris-Brest-Paris twice: once
in [2019 (had to scratch after 600km)](https://www.strava.com/activities/2647579112)
and in [2023 (finished with a few hours to spare)](https://www.strava.com/activities/9715990200).
