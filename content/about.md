Hello visitor,  
my name is Angelo Failla (also known as `pallotron`), and this is my personal site.

I am an Italian immigrant (I refuse to use the term "expat") living in Dublin, Ireland, since 2008.

In my professional life, I am a Production Engineer (also known as a Site Reliability Engineer or DevOps).
I worked 14 years at Meta (formerly Facebook) from March 2011 until April 2025, in the Dublin, Ireland office, and was always involved with Data Center Automation teams.
I'm currently enjoy summer off before looking for my next work adventure.

Outside of work, I love cooking, photography, and cycling.
Regarding cycling, I particularly enjoy long-distance cycling, also known as randonneuring or audaxing. I have completed several 200km, 300km, 400km, 600km, and 1000km rides. I have participated in the ~1200km Paris-Brest-Paris twice: once in [2019 (had to scratch after 600km)](https://www.strava.com/activities/2647579112) and in [2023 (finished with a few hours to spare)](https://www.strava.com/activities/9715990200).
