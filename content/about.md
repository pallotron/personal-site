Hello visitor,
my name is Angelo Failla (you might know me as `pallotron`), and this is my personal site.

I am italian immigrant (refuse to use the term "expat") living in Dublin, Ireland, since 2008.

In my professional life I work as a Production Engineer (akas Site Reliablity Engineer or DevOps) at Meta (formerly Facebook).
I have been there since March 2011.

On my spare time I love cooking, photography and cycling.
