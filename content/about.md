Hello visitor,  
my name is Angelo Failla (also known as `pallotron`), and this is my personal site.

I am an Italian immigrant (I refuse to use the term "expat") living in Dublin, Ireland, since 2008.

In my professional life, I am a Production Engineer (also known as a Site Reliability Engineer or DevOps).
I worked 14 years at Meta (formerly Facebook) from March 2011 until April 2025, in the Dublin, Ireland office, and was always involved with Data Center Automation teams.

After a summer break, I joined [Crusoe](https://crusoe.ai) as a Staff Site Reliability Engineer in September 2025.

Outside of work, I love cooking, cycling and photography.

Regarding cycling, I particularly enjoy long-distance cycling, also known as randonneuring or audaxing. I have completed several 200km, 300km, 400km, 600km, and 1000km rides. I have participated in the ~1200km Paris-Brest-Paris twice: once in [2019 (had to scratch after 600km)](https://www.strava.com/activities/2647579112) and in [2023 (finished with a few hours to spare)](https://www.strava.com/activities/9715990200).
