I've launched a new article [on my blog](/articles/observations_outside_meta/) dedicated to tracking my experience and opinions with working outside of Meta: the purely technical things I love, the things I don't, and what's consistently similar across the industry. This is strictly about the tech, not the corporate drama! Follow along and comment there!
