After 14 years, 10 at Facebook and another 4 at Meta, I am no longer a Facebook/Meta employee and it‚Äôs time to move on. And it‚Äôs not related to performance or layoffs.

You know those typical LinkedIn posts about "amazing journeys‚Äù with "rocket ships" and all that?
Yeah, I'm not going there!
There have definitely been ups and downs along the way, but that‚Äôs normal.

For the last 25 years, I‚Äôve pretty much gone straight from one job to another.
The one real break I took was an incredible four-week honeymoon in Australia before starting at Facebook‚Äîtotally worth delaying my start date!

Now, I‚Äôm planning to take spring and summer to focus on myself: cycling, swimming, working out, cooking, spending time with family and friends, and finally playing around with some of the tech outside Meta, which I haven‚Äôt had time for.

After this break, I‚Äôll start exploring my next moves.

Even with everything happening in the tech industry, and the world at large, I‚Äôm fortunate to know I am privileged to be able to weather this storm when there are people in much worse positions than my in life.

Thinking back on challenging times, one of the most difficult things I did in my life (besides riding Paris-Brest-Paris in 2023!) was back in 2008 during the last financial crisis/recession, when I left Italy for Ireland. I had quit my stable full-time job, had savings for just six months, was jobless and houseless, my English wasn't great, and I had no clear plan; I was hoping to build something from scratch. I survived that period, so I can certainly get through this one. üôÇ

To all the current and past colleagues I‚Äôve met throughout my time at Facebook/Meta: it was a pleasure working with you, and I certainly hope the feeling is mutual. Who knows, maybe our paths will cross again in the future.

I‚Äôm now excited to find new purpose outside of the usual project craziness, incidents, and bugs!
