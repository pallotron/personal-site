After 14 years, my time at Meta has come to an end, and I'm excited to embark on a new chapter of my life.
This event wasn't driven by performance concerns or recent restructuring.

I'll spare you the typical LinkedIn narrative of an "incredible journey" filled with "rocket ships" and "transformative visions."

For the past 25 years, I've been consistently employed, often transitioning directly from one role to the next. The exception was a memorable four-week honeymoon in Australia before joining Facebook â€“ a strategic move for delaying a start date!

Now, I'm looking forward to a few months of personal time: cycling, swimming, exercising, cooking, connecting with family, and exploring technical interests that took a backseat during my time at Meta.

Following this break, I'll be considering my next professional steps. I'm particularly drawn to the idea of contributing to a smaller organization with a more streamlined decision-making process and potentially a single time zone focus (though I realize that might be wishful thinking!).

While the tech industry and the world face uncertainty, I'm fortunate to have the financial stability to comfortably navigate this transition, thanks to my 14 years at Meta.

## Things I Won't Miss (A Lighthearted Perspective)

The following is a list compiled over 14 years. It's intended as a humorous reflection, so please don't take it personally if you're currently working on these areas. Those who know me are aware that I've been voicing these sentiments for years!

You might ask, "Angelo, why didn't you provide feedback?" Over time, I found it increasingly challenging to get feedback implemented. Minor issues often remained unresolved for years, and some of my concerns involved fundamental aspects that were difficult to change from within.

- Lengthy binary compilation times
- Slow CI/CD pipelines, optimized for single artifact deployment
- Large, statically compiled binaries consuming excessive memory and disk space, causing operational challenges on resource-constrained devices. My enthusiasm for statically compiled approaches waned over the years.
- The proliferation of Widely Distributed Service/Binaries. Why not a unified agent? If a massive engineering team can collaborate on a single codebase for the web, why not apply the same approach to a unified agent for bare metal?
- `Thrift`, initially intended to facilitate interoperability between languages and services with native language implementations, was later superseded by `fbthrift`, forcing teams to adopt bloated, resource-intensive C++ libraries due to a lack of resources for native implementations.
- Lack of API versioning in `Thrift`, while `gRPC` offers it. Modifying `.thrift` files (deprecating fields, etc.) can be a risky endeavor.
- The specific way `Python` is utilized at Meta.
- The challenges of working across time zones, attending late-night meetings, and effectively working two workdays (EMEA + US) to stay aligned. Working remotely from headquarters significantly amplified these challenges, which I experienced for 14 years.
- Servers and switches configured with Pacific time instead of UTC, leading to 14 years of mental time zone conversions.
- The recurring need to point out the lack of time zone considerations in date/time pickers in new tools.
- The impact of intrusive spyware software on corporate devices, affecting performance and user experience.
- Recent shifts in company culture, which have changed the character of the organization I initially joined.
- The "Not Invented Here" syndrome.
- Workchat: The shift away from IRC has fostered silos between teams and employees, particularly during COVID. Real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing have become more difficult. Also technically a mess, uncapable of using screen real estate efficiently, trying to predict keystorkes and super slow.

## Things I Will Miss

- `Scuba`, when it was easier to get capacity and perform queries without getting throttled
- `Tupperware`, when it was easier to get capacity
- `ODS`, detectors, and related tooling
- `configerator`, but please make it hermetic
- `Phabricator`, and our code review processes
- Meta's `Mercurial` fork, and development flows, stack diffs, stacked diff reviewes, though I am recently using `sapling` to work on my github projects and I am loving it
- `SevManager` and blameless incident management and review processes
- Workplace (not WorkChat), amazing collaboration tool IMHO, has helped me making my voice being heard in the mothership
- My exceptional colleagues. I've enjoyed working with you all.
- The overall compensation and the RSUs I leave behind :D

Now, I'm eager to rediscover purpose beyond the constant demands of projects, incidents, and bugs!
