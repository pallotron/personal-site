Alright: funemployment is done!

After a fantastic summer of cycling, delicious food, and quality time with family and friends, I'm excited to share some news: in about one week time I will be starting a new chapter at [Crusoe](https://crusoe.ai/).

Leaving Facebook/Meta after 14 years is a significant change for me, but I'm excited by the challenge.

I’m especially looking forward to the camaraderie and drive of a smaller, close-knit, collaborative environment, which brings back great memories from my Facebook’s early days.

I will be also working with some former colleagues again!
